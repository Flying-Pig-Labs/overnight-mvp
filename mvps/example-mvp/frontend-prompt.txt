### taskStore
- State: tasks, filters, sorting, loading
- Actions: fetchTasks, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask, setFilter, setSorting

### categoryStore
- State: categories, selectedCategory
- Actions: fetchCategories, createCategory, updateCategory, deleteCategory, selectCategory

### uiStore
- State: darkMode, sidebarOpen, notifications
- Actions: toggleDarkMode, toggleSidebar, addNotification, removeNotification

## API Integration

Base URL: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`

- POST /tasks (Task Management)
- GET /tasks (Task Management)
- GET /tasks/{id} (Task Management)
- PUT /tasks/{id} (Task Management)
- DELETE /tasks/{id} (Task Management)
- GET /categories (Task Categories)
- POST /categories (Task Categories)
- PUT /categories/{id} (Task Categories)
- DELETE /categories/{id} (Task Categories)

## UI/UX Requirements

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Breakpoints: 640px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for routes
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting by route

4. **Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - Offline state handling

## Additional Features

4. Use CSS variables for theme values
5. Support dark mode with Tailwind's dark: modifier

## Development Setup

Please create a complete, production-ready application with:
- All pages and components fully implemented
- Complete TypeScript types
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Form validation with Zod or Yup
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper accessibility attributes
