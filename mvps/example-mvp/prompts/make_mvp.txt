Generate a complete MVP specification that:
1. Expands the description into concrete features
2. Defines clear REST API endpoints for each feature
3. Creates a normalized data model with proper relationships
4. Lists specific UI pages and components needed
5. Includes relevant technical requirements
6. Focuses on MVP scope - essential features only

Important formatting rules:
- Use the exact YAML structure from the template
- Keep feature names concise (2-3 words)
- Use lowercase for model names, camelCase for field names
- Include realistic field types: string, number, boolean, timestamp, array, object
- Make sure all endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Include user stories that match the features

Return ONLY the YAML specification, no additional text or explanation.
